# ESPXProjects

A repository containing project assignments for the **Real Time Embedded Systems** class of the Aristotle University's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

## Preperation Project - Producer/Consumer Test

The objective of this assignment was to modify an existing demo of the **producer-consumer** problem using **PTHREADS** and written by *Andrae Muys*.
The modified code stores in a queue functions along with any parameters that the user may pass, generated by a number of *producer* threads, while *consumer* threads then execute them. More specifically, *producers* generate array of *10* integers that are parsed inside a simple function calculating their *sin*.

### Performance Evaluation

The modified code using **gettimeofday()** calculates important metrics in order to evaluate the optimal number of *consumer* threads with a given amount of *producer* threads.
The ` evaluation.py ` script compiles the code and creates performance metrics for a number of test cases.

## Final Project

The goal of this assignment is to implement a real-time system on a **Raspberry Pi** that receives asynchronous trade data for the following cryptocurrency symbols via the **OKX WebSocket public channel**:

`
BTC-USDT, ADA-USDT, ETH-USDT, DOGE-USDT, XRP-USDT, SOL-USDT, LTC-USDT, BNB-USDT
`

The system:

1. **Logs trades to files**: Each symbol has its own file, and every received trade is recorded immediately.
2. **Computes moving averages and volume**: Every minute, computes the 15-minute moving average of trade prices and the total volume, saving them in a separate file.
3. **Compute Pearson correlation**: Every minute, calculates the Pearson correlation between the last 8 moving averages for each symbol and the corresponding moving averages of all other symbols.
