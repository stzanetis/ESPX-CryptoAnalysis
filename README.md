# ESPXProjects
A repository containing project assignments for the Real Time Embedded Systems class of the Aristotle University's Electrical and Computer Engineering Department.

## Preperation Project - Producer/Consumer Test
The objective of this assignment was to modify an existing demo of the **producer-consumer** problem using **PTHREADS** and written by *Andrae Muys*.
The modified code stores in a queue functions along with any parameters that the user may pass, generated by a number of *producer* threads, while *consumer* threads then execute them. More specifically, *producers* generate array of *10* integers that are parsed inside a simple function calculating their *sin*.

### Performance Evaluation
The modified code using **gettimeofday()** calculates important metrics in order to evaluate the optimal number of *consumer* threads with a given amount of *producer* threads.
The ` evaluation.py ` script compiles the code and creates performance metrics for a number of test cases.
